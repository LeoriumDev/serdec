## ðŸ”§ Code Guidelines

- Keep functions small and focused.
- Always check for `NULL` before dereferencing pointers.
- Free any allocated memory properly to avoid leaks.
- Keep public APIs clean and consistent.
- Write defensive code where appropriate (e.g., validate inputs).
- Match the existing code style (tabs, spacing, function names).

- Feel free to open a pull request.
