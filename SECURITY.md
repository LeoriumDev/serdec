# Security Policy

## Introduction

Thank you for your interest in improving the security of **Serdec**!

We are committed to protecting users of Serdec and appreciate responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities. This document outlines how to report vulnerabilities and our process for handling them.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in Serdec, **please report it privately** by following these steps:

- Contact us at **contact@leorium.com**.
- Provide as much information as possible to help us understand and reproduce the issue, including:
  - A clear description of the vulnerability.
  - Steps to reproduce the issue (proof of concept is very helpful).
  - The potential impact and any suggested mitigation strategies.
  - Your contact information (optional if you wish to stay anonymous).

**Please do not create a public GitHub issue or discuss the vulnerability publicly until we have had a chance to investigate and address it.**

We take security reports seriously and aim to respond to all reports within **72 hours**.

## What to Expect

Upon receiving a security report:

1. **Acknowledgment:** We will acknowledge your report as soon as possible (typically within 72 hours).
2. **Investigation:** We will investigate the reported vulnerability and determine its impact and severity.
3. **Resolution:** If confirmed, we will develop a fix, prioritize it based on severity, and prepare a release if necessary.
4. **Disclosure:** Once the fix is released, we will credit the reporter (if desired) and disclose the vulnerability details responsibly.

We may coordinate a public disclosure timeline with you once a patch is available.

## Supported Versions

We generally provide security updates for the latest stable release of Serdec.  
Older versions may not receive backported fixes unless explicitly stated.

| Version | Supported |
|:--------|:----------|
| 1.x     | ‚úÖ Yes     |
| 0.x     | ‚ùå No      |

## Scope

This security policy applies to:

- Source code in the Serdec repository.
- Official releases published by the maintainers.
- Documentation where relevant to security issues.

Issues **outside** the scope include:

- Third-party dependencies (unless integrated into Serdec directly).
- User configuration errors unrelated to Serdec bugs.

## Responsible Disclosure Guidelines

We ask that all reporters follow these guidelines for responsible disclosure:

- Do not publicly disclose the vulnerability until a fix has been made available or coordinated with the maintainers.
- Avoid exploiting the vulnerability or accessing user data beyond what is necessary to demonstrate the issue.
- Act in good faith to avoid privacy violations, destruction of data, or interruption of service.
- Give us a reasonable amount of time to address the issue before disclosure.

Following responsible disclosure allows us to protect Serdec users more effectively.
